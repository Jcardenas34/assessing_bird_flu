With the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects still clear in the minds of many americans and citizens world wide, it is distressing to think of how humanitie's next global pandemic will emierge, and how ready we our institutions are handle it.
Regradless of the discofort, it is a critical national and global health concern that we must prepare for, by identifing and mitigatating the risk that future disease outbreaks pose. 
In this repo, I asses the risk that Bird Flu specifically, poses to the United States and and the global community by performing a review of the case rate thoughout the years of 2000-2025 within the United States, and offer insights on locations of most likely spread, ways to mitigate spread with the goal in mind to potentially minimize or prevent the next major global pandemic.
